// Comparison operators

/*
  As the name suggests, these operator compare two values and return true or
  false. They are:

  == - Equity
  === - Strict equity (checks value and type)
  != - Difference (checks if one value is different from another)
  !== - Strict difference (same as strict equity)
  > - Checks if is greater than the compared value
  < - Checks if is less than the compared value
  >= - Checks if is equal or greater than the compared value
  <= - Checks if is equal or less then the compared value

  Ex:
    const a = 2
    const b = '2'

    console.log(a == b) // -> True
    console.log(a === b) // -> False
    console.log(3 >= a) // -> True
    console.log(3 <= a ) // -> False
